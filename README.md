# Spring
Spring framework from scratch

## Why Spring?

Becasue is a simplier and lightweight alternative to J2EE. Because early version of EJB were extremely complex (Multiple deploymnet descriptor, interfaces...)

### Goals of Spring

* Lightweight development with java POJOs
* Dependency injection to promote loose coupling
* Declarative programming with Aspect-Oriented-Programming (AOP)
* Minimize the boilerplate java code

## The steps to start a Spring project manually

* Create a Eclispe project
* Download Spring JAR files
* Add JAR files to Eclispe project (Build path)

The automatic way is by using a build automation tool like Maven.
